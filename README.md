# Poppel

Portable directory structure format, inspired by [exdir](https://github.com/CINPLA/exdir) and HDF5.

## Build

### Use Poppel

To be added.

### Build tests

If dependencies are already installed by vcpkg, the following steps are sufficient to generate build scripts.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path-to-vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
```
